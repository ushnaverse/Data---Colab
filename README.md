**Project: Automated Data Pipeline for Student ID Matching and Classification**

Description: It is a customized personal project built by a student for a community initiative by data engineering pipeline using Python to automate student form data ingestion, transformation, and classification. The system extracts IDs, cleans batch data, and implements matching logic to classify records, generating a structured output in Excel with color-coded status indicators. Leveraged Pandas for data transformation,
Openpyxl for data export, and designed ETL processes to streamline data verification and enhance workflow efficiency in student data processing.

As a computer scientist, we all know we forget what we coded the things for :P so I have added all the comments and descriptions in the same file for a better understanding if you follow it step by step 

Happy Coding :)
